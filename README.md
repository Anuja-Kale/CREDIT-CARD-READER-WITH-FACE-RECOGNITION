# CREDIT-CARD-READER-WITH-FACE-RECOGNITION


INTRODUCTION

Credit and debit cards are fast becoming the most common payment mode of big purchasers; pushing more and more businesses towards credit card processing services. 
A credit card transaction starts with a swipe at a credit card terminal or by the entry of the card details (card-less transaction) into a billing system. Before the amount moves from the card holder's account into your business account, certain validations, checks and deductions are made. 
All these tasks are managed by the credit card processor. Credit card processing companies make sure credit card transactions are processed accurately and on time, for a fee. As more and more customers get comfortable with cashless transactions, businesses are pulling all the stops to make credit card transactions secure and painless. Cashless transactions benefit your business. 
Credit card fraud is the biggest risk in credit card transactions. Credit cards are stolen and used to make large purchases, often leading to heavy losses for the credit card processing service and the business.

FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS-


In general, an automatic face recognition system is comprised of three steps. Their basic flowchart is given in Figure . Among them, detection may include face edge detection, segmentation and localization, namely obtaining a pre-processed intensity face image from an input scene, either simple or cluttered, locating its position and segmenting the image out of the background. Feature extraction may denote the acquirement of the image features from the image such as visual features, statistical pixel features; transform coefficient features, and algebraic features, with emphasis on the algebraic features, which represent the intrinsic attributes of an image
